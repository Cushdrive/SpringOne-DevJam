*Appendix 4 - Apigee Edge Microgateway*

Apigee Edge Microgateway is a secure, HTTP-based message processor for
APIs. Its main job is to process requests and responses to and from
backend services securely while asynchronously pushing valuable API
execution data/meta data to and from Apigee Edge.

Typically, Edge Microgateway is installed within a trusted network in
close proximity to backend target services; often, the μ-gateway will be
co-located on the same OS image as the target service. μGwy provides
enterprise-grade security, and some key plugin features such as spike
arrest, quotas, and so on. The μ-gateway leverages an Apigee Edge Public
Cloud instance, or an Apigee Edge private cloud (on premises)
installation for other aspects of API Management like analytics, and
developer management. You can install Edge Microgateway in the same data
center or even on the same machine as your backend services.

**Key features and benefits**

-   **Traffic management:** APIs proxied through Edge Microgateway never
    need to leave the perimeter of your corporate network. You get the
    Analytics and security capabilities of Apigee Edge public cloud,
    without sending your transaction data over public networks.

-   **Security:** Edge Microgateway authenticates requests with a signed
    bearer token or API key issued to each client app by Apigee Edge.
    This means you can secure your internal-to-internal APIs without
    writing new server-side code.

-   **Rapid deployment:** Unlike a full deployment of Apigee Edge, you
    can deploy and run an instance of Edge Microgateway within a
    matter of minutes.

-   **Network proximity:** You can install and manage Edge Microgateway
    in the same machine, subnet, or data center as the backend target
    APIs with which Edge Microgateway interacts. Same-machine proxy
    deployment means that proxied traffic does not incur additional
    network capacity, and does not require an additional VM. Super
    low footprint.

-   **Analytics:** Edge Microgateway asynchronously delivers API
    execution data to Apigee Edge, where it is processed by the Edge
    Analytics system. You can use the full suite of Edge Analytics
    metrics, dashboards, and APIs.

-   **Reduced latency:** All proxy activity is done on the local
    datacenter network, meaning the overhead of the proxy is very
    very low. All communication with Apigee Edge is asynchronous and
    does not happen as part of the client request pipeline. This
    allows Edge Microgateway to collect API data and send it to Apigee
    Edge without affecting latency of the runtime transactions.

**Objectives**

In this lab you will go through configuring, get working Edge
Microgateway installation capable of processing an API. You'll make
several secure, test API calls through Edge Microgateway to the API's
backend service and see how Apigee Edge processes analytics data from
Edge Microgateway.

The following credentials are required to start edge micro

key: xxxxx

secret: xxxx

edgemicro configuration complete!
```

-   **Copy the** Key, and Secret for later parts of the exercise.

-   Using the key and secret you just viewed; verify that the edge micro
    is configured correctly with the Edge Cloud org.

```
./edgemicro verify -o <org-name> -e <env-name> -k <key> -s <secret>
```

You should see happy messages. If not, you'll need to stop, and diagnose.

The configuration done so far allows Edge Microgateway to bootstrap
itself to Apigee Edge. The Edge Microgateway agent manages this
bootstrapping process, which kicks off whenever you start or restart
Edge Microgateway. After the bootstrapping succeeds, Edge Microgateway
retrieves a payload of additional configuration information from Apigee
Edge.

### Create a passthrough API Proxy

Create a new 'Reverse Proxy' in Apigee Edge, use the following settings

    -   Proxy Name: edgemicro_{your_initials}_hotels
    -   Proxy Base Path: /v1/edgemicro_{your_initials}_hotels
    -   Existing API: http://api.usergrid.com/{org-name}/sandbox
    -   Description: Edge Micro Proxy that will run locally to the node.js service
    -   Authorization: Pass through (none)
    -   Virtual Hosts: default
    -   Deploy Environments: test

**Note:** Edge μ-gateway-aware proxy names must always begin with the prefix **edgemicro\_**

-   We have created an API Proxy that will be fetched by Edge Micro
    gateway, when it starts locally

-   Add the API Proxy you created to your Hospitality Basic Product

    -   From the Apigee Edge Management UI, go to Publish → API Products
    -   Select your API Product: {your_initials} Hospitality Basic Product
    -   Click on Edit Button on the top right
    -   Click on + API Proxy button and add your new API Proxy to the Product

***Start the Edge Microgateway***

    -   Before continuing, open a separate terminal window. This is where the microgateway will run.

    -   Execute this command to start the server:  
    ```
    edgemicro start -o <your org> -e <your env> -k <key> -s <secret>
    ```

    Verify that the last few lines of output from that command indicates success:   

    ```
    df7e82c0-378f-11e6-b5e9-314a56237a39 edge micro listening on port 8000
    edge micro started
    edgemicro started successfully.
    ```

**Note:** The tutorial assumes that the cli directory is in your
PATH. If you did not put it in your PATH, then you need to execute CLI
commands from the cli directory

**Note:** The **UID** is the unique id for this instance of Edge
Microgateway. You use this ID when retrieving log and monitoring
information about Edge Microgateway. See the *Edge Microgateway
Administrator*'s Guide for more information.


At this point, the microgateway retrieves a payload of Edge Microgateway
configuration information from Apigee Edge. This information includes:

-   ![](./media/image13.png)
    The public key we created and stored previously in the Apigee vault.

-   ![](./media/image12.png)
    A JSON representation of all Edge Microgatewayaware proxies that exist in
    the organization/environment. These are all proxies that are named
    with the prefix edgemicro\_.

-   ![](./media/image16.png)
    A JSON representation of all of
    the API products that exist in the organization.

With this information, Edge Microgateway knows which proxies and proxy
paths are allowed. If configured, it uses the product information
to enforce security (in the same way as any API proxy does on Apigee
Edge, where developer app keys have an association with products).

-   To test our API Proxy, call it via curl:
```
curl -i http://localhost:8000/v1/edgemicro_{your_initials}_hotels/hotels
```

-   You should see an authorization error, indicating your Micro Gateway is
    listening for the API you have configured in the previous step

```
{"error":"missing_authorization","error_description":"Missing Authorization header"}
```

-   Run the following command to get the JWT Token - replace the orgname with your org name,
    and take the key and secret from your developer app registered against your
    API Product

```
curl -i -X POST "http://{orgname}-test.apigee.net/edgemicro-auth/token" \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
-d '{ "grant_type": "client_credentials", "client_id":"{key}", "client_secret": "{secret}" }'
```

The response you see will have a very long string, looking something like so:

```
"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLc9.eyJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbl9u....kkBnE40jk\_2trmZkP6uf4-mcgUw91-qKofaw"
```

-   Make the API Call with a bearer token you received in the step above

```
curl -i -H "Authorization:Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}" http://localhost:8000/v1/edgemicro_{your_initials}_hotels/hotels
```

-   You should see the response json:
    ```
     {
     "action" : "get",
     "application" : "5d4057c0-3ace-11e5-9fd6-0dff5edbe5ab",
     "params" : { },
     "path" : "/hotels",
     "uri" : "https://api.usergrid.com/ssridhar/sandbox/hotels",
     "entities" : [ {
     "uuid" : "7d20227a-5c82-11e5-a131-a7fee2bde904",
     "type" : "hotel",
     "name" : "MotifÃ‚ Seattle",
     "created" : 1442415121943,
     "modified" : 1442415121943,
     "address1" : "1415 5th Ave",
     "airportCode" : "SEA",
     "amenityMask" : 7798786,
      ……
    }
    ```

You have used the credentials you received from your Edge org on cloud
and you have used them on your local Micro Gateway. You are able to
manage your APIs centrally, while the enforcement is happening locally.

Summary
-------

That completes this hands-on lesson. In this lesson you learned about
setting up an Edge Micro Gateway, creating an API Proxy and
corresponding life cycle on your Edge org. You now have a fully
functioning and secure Edge Microgateway that can run your APIs locally,
picking up the security credentials from your Edge org.
